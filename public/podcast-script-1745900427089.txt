<emphasis level="strong">Article 1:</emphasis> Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation Outcomes for High-Risk AML: A Report From the Children&apos;s Oncology Group..
From Huang and colleagues.
Published in Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology in 2025.<break time="300ms"/>
This cross-study analysis combined data from COG trials AAML0531 and AAML1031 to evaluate outcomes of hematopoietic stem cell transplantation  in pediatric AML patients reclassified into contemporarily defined high-risk groups based on measurable residual disease  and cryptic cytogenetic/molecular  alterations. Comparing HSCT in first complete remission  versus chemotherapy alone, the study found that HSCT was significantly associated with decreased relapse and improved disease-free survival  in both the high-risk CM group  and the standard-risk CM with positive MRD group . These benefits were largely consistent across subgroups, except for patients with chromosome 7 or 5 loss. Multivariable analysis further supported the association of HSCT with improved outcomes. These findings strongly support the use of HSCT as consolidation therapy for pediatric patients with contemporarily defined high-risk AML in CR1.

From Llombart-Cussac and colleagues.
Published in Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology in 2025.<break time="300ms"/>
This phase II randomized study investigated palbociclib rechallenge with alternative endocrine therapy  versus ET alone in patients with HR+/HER2- advanced breast cancer who progressed on first-line palbociclib-based ET. The study found no statistically significant improvement in investigator-assessed progression-free survival  with palbociclib rechallenge plus ET compared to ET alone. Palbociclib rechallenge was associated with a higher incidence of Grade ≥3 adverse events. These results suggest that palbociclib rechallenge in combination with alternative ET does not offer a significant clinical benefit in terms of PFS in this specific second-line setting.

<break time="700ms"/><emphasis level="strong">Article 3:</emphasis> Zongertinib in Previously Treated HER2-Mutant Non-Small-Cell Lung Cancer..
From Heymach and colleagues.
Published in The New England journal of medicine in 2025.<break time="300ms"/>
This phase 1a-1b multicohort trial evaluated zongertinib, an oral, irreversible, HER2-selective tyrosine kinase inhibitor, in previously treated patients with advanced or metastatic HER2-mutant non-small-cell lung cancer. Zongertinib demonstrated significant clinical activity, particularly in patients with tyrosine kinase domain mutations receiving 120 mg daily, achieving a 71% objective response rate with a median duration of response of 14.1 months and median progression-free survival of 12.4 months. The safety profile was favorable, with grade 3 or higher drug-related adverse events occurring in 3-25% across cohorts and notably no drug-related interstitial lung disease observed. These results suggest zongertinib is a promising oral therapeutic option for previously treated HER2-mutant NSCLC, offering substantial clinical benefit with manageable toxicity.

<break time="700ms"/><emphasis level="strong">Article 4:</emphasis> Nonoperative Management of Mismatch Repair-Deficient Tumors..
From Cercek and colleagues.
Published in The New England journal of medicine in 2025.<break time="300ms"/>
This phase 2 study investigated neoadjuvant dostarlimab, a PD-1 blocking agent, for 6 months in patients with early-stage, mismatch repair-deficient  solid tumors amenable to curative surgery. Across both cohorts , a high proportion of patients who completed treatment achieved a clinical complete response  and elected nonoperative management . The study demonstrated promising 2-year recurrence-free survival  with a favorable safety profile, primarily involving reversible grade 1 or 2 adverse events. These findings suggest that neoadjuvant PD-1 blockade can lead to significant organ preservation in early-stage dMMR solid tumors without compromising the option for curative resection, potentially establishing a new treatment paradigm.

<break time="700ms"/><emphasis level="strong">Article 5:</emphasis> Spatial mapping of transcriptomic plasticity in metastatic pancreatic cancer..
From Pei and colleagues.
Published in Nature in 2025.<break time="300ms"/>
This study employed spatially resolved transcriptomics on rapid autopsy samples from 13 patients with treatment-refractory pancreatic cancer to map transcriptomic heterogeneity in primary tumors and diverse metastases. Findings revealed significant transcriptomic shifts in cancer cell lineage states between primary and metastatic sites, alongside diverse patient-specific clonal evolution and dissemination patterns. Importantly, distinct cancer cell lineage states correlated with specific tumor microenvironment features, such as the spatial proximity of myCAFs to aggressive basal-like cells, which was associated with plasma cell exclusion. Neighboring cell analysis suggested CXCR4-CXCL12 signaling underlies this immune exclusion, collectively underscoring the complex interplay between cancer cell states and the microenvironment in driving refractory disease.

<break time="700ms"/><emphasis level="strong">Article 6:</emphasis> Targeting PIKfyve-driven lipid metabolism in pancreatic cancer..
From Cheng and colleagues.
Published in Nature in 2025.<break time="300ms"/>
This research identifies PIKfyve, a lipid kinase integral to lysosomal function, as a critical vulnerability in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma . Using a genetically engineered mouse model and metabolic analyses, PIKfyve was found essential for PDAC progression, with its inhibition driving a compensatory upregulation of de novo lipid synthesis, a process driven by the KRAS-MAPK pathway in PDAC. Preclinical studies in human and mouse models demonstrated that simultaneous targeting of PIKfyve and KRAS-MAPK resulted in tumor elimination. These findings suggest that disrupting lipid metabolism through PIKfyve inhibition creates a synthetic lethal interaction with KRAS-MAPK-directed therapies, offering a promising novel therapeutic approach for PDAC.

<break time="700ms"/><emphasis level="strong">Article 7:</emphasis> Geographic and age variations in mutational processes in colorectal cancer..
From D&amp;#xed and colleagues.
Published in Nature in 2025.<break time="300ms"/>
This study analyzed 981 colorectal cancer genomes from 11 countries to investigate whether mutational processes contribute to geographic and age-related incidence variations. While microsatellite unstable cancers showed no major differences, microsatellite-stable cases exhibited variations in mutation burden and signatures across countries, suggesting diverse mutagenic exposures. Notably, signatures SBS88 and ID18, linked to the bacteria-produced mutagen colibactin, were enriched in countries with higher CRC incidence and significantly more prevalent in early-onset colorectal cancers compared to older patients. Colibactin exposure was also associated with APC driver mutations, suggesting an early role in tumor development. These findings highlight geographic and age-related differences in CRC mutational landscapes and propose that early-life exposure to colibactin-producing bacteria may be a contributing factor to the increasing incidence of early-onset colorectal cancer.

<break time="700ms"/><emphasis level="strong">Article 8:</emphasis> Tumor-Infiltrating Clonal Hematopoiesis..
From Pich and colleagues.
Published in The New England journal of medicine in 2025.<break time="300ms"/>
This study characterized tumor-infiltrating clonal hematopoiesis  in large cohorts of patients with NSCLC and other solid tumors, finding it present in a significant proportion of patients with clonal hematopoiesis of indeterminate potential . TI-CH was independently associated with an increased risk of disease recurrence or death in NSCLC and increased all-cause mortality in pan-cancer cohorts, beyond the risk conferred by CHIP alone. Mechanistically, TET2-mutant CHIP, a strong predictor of TI-CH, enhanced monocyte migration, fostered a myeloid-rich tumor microenvironment, and promoted tumor growth in experimental models. These findings indicate that aging-related hematologic clonal expansion, when infiltrating tumors, significantly impacts clinical outcomes and contributes to tumor evolution by altering the tumor microenvironment.

<break time="700ms"/><emphasis level="strong">Article 9:</emphasis> ADAGIO: A Phase IIb, Open-Label, Single-Arm, Multicenter Study Assessing the Efficacy and Safety of Adavosertib  as Treatment for Recurrent or Persistent Uterine Serous Carcinoma..
From Liu and colleagues.
Published in Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology in 2025.<break time="300ms"/>
This phase IIb, single-arm study evaluated adavosertib  in 104 patients with recurrent/persistent uterine serous carcinoma previously treated with platinum-based chemotherapy. The study reported an objective response rate  of 26.0% by blinded independent central review, with a median duration of response of 4.7 months and median progression-free survival of 2.8 months. Adavosertib demonstrated significant toxicity at this dose, with 60.6% of patients experiencing Grade ≥3 treatment-related adverse events, leading to discontinuation in 14.7%. While no single predictive biomarker was identified, exploratory analysis suggested a potential association between CCNE1 amplification or high cyclin E1 expression and response. These findings indicate modest antitumor activity for adavosertib in this population but highlight the need for dose optimization or alternative schedules to improve tolerability, potentially guided by biomarker selection.
