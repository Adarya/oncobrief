<emphasis>Article 1:</emphasis> Tumor-Infiltrating Clonal Hematopoiesis..
From Pich and colleagues.
Published in The New England journal of medicine in 2025.<break time="300ms"/>
This study characterized tumor-infiltrating clonal hematopoiesis (TI-CH), defined as the presence of clonal hematopoiesis of indeterminate potential (CHIP) mutations in tumors, across large cohorts of patients with non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and various solid tumors. They found that TI-CH was present in a significant proportion of CHIP patients and independently predicted an increased risk of disease recurrence or death in NSCLC and increased all-cause mortality in solid tumors compared to CHIP without TI-CH. Mechanistically, TET2-mutant CHIP, a strong predictor of TI-CH, enhanced monocyte migration, fostered a myeloid-rich tumor microenvironment, and promoted tumor growth in experimental models. These findings demonstrate that TI-CH is a prevalent and adverse prognostic factor in solid tumors, highlighting a novel link between age-related hematologic clonal expansion and tumor evolution by influencing the tumor microenvironment.
