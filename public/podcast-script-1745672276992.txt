<emphasis>Article 1:</emphasis> Tumor-Infiltrating Clonal Hematopoiesis..
From Pich and colleagues.
Published in The New England journal of medicine in 2025.<break time="300ms"/>
This study characterized tumor-infiltrating clonal hematopoiesis (TI-CH), where CHIP mutations are detected in tumors, across large cohorts of patients with NSCLC and other solid tumors. They found that TI-CH was present in a significant proportion of patients with CHIP and independently predicted an increased risk of disease recurrence or death in NSCLC and increased all-cause mortality in pan-cancer cohorts. Furthermore, TET2 mutations were strongly associated with TI-CH and functionally demonstrated the ability to enhance monocyte migration, enrich the tumor microenvironment with myeloid cells, and promote tumor growth in experimental models. These findings indicate that aging-related clonal hematopoiesis, specifically when infiltrating the tumor, plays a significant role in cancer evolution and patient prognosis.

From Liu and colleagues.

This phase IIb, single-arm study (ADAGIO) evaluated adavosertib in 104 patients with recurrent/persistent uterine serous carcinoma previously treated with platinum-based chemotherapy. The study demonstrated an objective response rate of 26.0% by blinded independent central review, with a median duration of response of 4.7 months and median progression-free survival of 2.8 months. Exploratory biomarker analysis suggested a potential association between CCNE1 amplification/high cyclin E1 expression and response. However, adavosertib at 300 mg once daily was poorly tolerated, with 60.6% of patients experiencing Grade â‰¥3 treatment-related adverse events, leading to discontinuation in 14.7%. While showing some activity, the toxicity profile at this dose necessitates further investigation into optimized dosing or alternative strategies for Wee1 inhibition in this patient population, potentially guided by biomarkers.
