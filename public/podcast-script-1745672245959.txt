<emphasis>Article 1:</emphasis> Tumor-Infiltrating Clonal Hematopoiesis..
From Pich and colleagues.
Published in The New England journal of medicine in 2025.<break time="300ms"/>
This study characterized tumor-infiltrating clonal hematopoiesis (TI-CH), defined as high variant-allele frequency CHIP mutations detected in tumors, across large cohorts of patients with NSCLC and other solid tumors. They found that TI-CH was present in a significant proportion of patients with CHIP and independently predicted increased risk of recurrence or death in NSCLC and increased all-cause mortality in solid tumors compared to CHIP without TI-CH. Mechanistically, TET2-mutant CHIP, a strong predictor of TI-CH, was shown to enhance monocyte migration, enrich the tumor microenvironment with myeloid cells, and promote tumor growth in experimental models. These findings indicate that aging-related clonal hematopoiesis, when infiltrating the tumor, significantly impacts patient prognosis and actively contributes to tumor evolution by remodeling the immune microenvironment.
