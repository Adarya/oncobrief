<emphasis level="strong">Article 1:</emphasis> Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation Outcomes for High-Risk AML: A Report From the Children&apos;s Oncology Group..
From Huang and colleagues.
Published in Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology in 2025.<break time="300ms"/>
This cross-study analysis combined data from COG AAML0531 and AAML1031 to evaluate hematopoietic stem cell transplantation  outcomes versus chemotherapy in pediatric high-risk AML patients in first complete remission, using contemporary risk definitions including specific cytogenetic/molecular alterations and measurable residual disease . The study found that HSCT in CR1 was associated with significantly decreased relapse and improved disease-free survival  compared to chemotherapy alone in both the high-risk cytogenetic/molecular group and the standard-risk group with positive MRD. For the high-risk group, 5-year DFS was nearly doubled with HSCT , and this benefit was confirmed in multivariable analysis and across most subgroups. These findings support the use of HSCT as consolidation therapy for pediatric patients with AML classified as high-risk by current prognostic criteria, offering improved survival outcomes.

From Llombart-Cussac and colleagues.
Published in Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology in 2025.<break time="300ms"/>
The PALMIRA trial, a phase II randomized study, investigated palbociclib rechallenge plus alternative endocrine therapy  versus ET alone in patients with HR+/HER2- advanced breast cancer who progressed on first-line palbociclib. Patients were randomized 2:1 to receive palbociclib with second-line ET or ET alone. The study found no statistically significant improvement in investigator-assessed progression-free survival with palbociclib rechallenge , although Grade ≥3 adverse events were more frequent in the rechallenge arm. These results indicate that palbociclib rechallenge with alternative ET does not offer a significant clinical benefit in this setting.

<break time="700ms"/><emphasis level="strong">Article 3:</emphasis> Zongertinib in Previously Treated HER2-Mutant Non-Small-Cell Lung Cancer..
From Heymach and colleagues.
Published in The New England journal of medicine in 2025.<break time="300ms"/>
This multicohort phase 1a-1b trial evaluated zongertinib, an oral HER2-selective tyrosine kinase inhibitor, in previously treated patients with advanced or metastatic HER2-mutant NSCLC across different mutation types and prior therapies. The primary analysis demonstrated substantial objective response rates, including 71%  in patients with tyrosine kinase domain mutations receiving the 120 mg dose, with a median duration of response of 14.1 months and median progression-free survival of 12.4 months. Responses were also seen in patients with prior ADC treatment  and non-tyrosine kinase domain mutations , with a favorable safety profile characterized by mainly low-grade adverse events and no drug-related interstitial lung disease. These results indicate that zongertinib provides meaningful clinical benefit with manageable toxicity in previously treated HER2-mutant NSCLC, suggesting its promise as a targeted therapy for this challenging population.

<break time="700ms"/><emphasis level="strong">Article 4:</emphasis> Nonoperative Management of Mismatch Repair-Deficient Tumors..
From Cercek and colleagues.
Published in The New England journal of medicine in 2025.<break time="300ms"/>
This phase 2 study investigated neoadjuvant dostarlimab, a PD-1 inhibitor, in patients with early-stage mismatch repair-deficient  solid tumors amenable to curative surgery, including rectal and non-rectal sites. A high proportion of patients across both cohorts achieved a clinical complete response  and elected nonoperative management , demonstrating significant organ preservation potential. The treatment showed promising 2-year recurrence-free survival  with a favorable safety profile, primarily involving reversible grade 1 or 2 adverse events, without compromising the option for subsequent surgery. These findings suggest that neoadjuvant PD-1 blockade can effectively lead to organ preservation in a substantial number of patients with early-stage dMMR solid tumors, extending the potential of this approach beyond rectal cancer.

<break time="700ms"/><emphasis level="strong">Article 5:</emphasis> Spatial mapping of transcriptomic plasticity in metastatic pancreatic cancer..
From Pei and colleagues.
Published in Nature in 2025.<break time="300ms"/>
This study employed spatially resolved transcriptomics on 55 samples from rapid autopsies of 13 patients with treatment-refractory pancreatic cancer, analyzing primary tumors and multi-organ metastases to map transcriptomic heterogeneity. Findings revealed significant transcriptomic shifts in cancer cell lineage states between primary and metastatic sites, diverse patient-specific clonal evolution, and the co-existence of multiple lineage states within tissues. Crucially, specific lineage states correlated with distinct tumor microenvironment features, such as the spatial proximity of myCAFs to aggressive &apos;basal-like&apos; cancer cells, which was associated with plasma cell exclusion. Neighboring cell analysis implicated CXCR4-CXCL12 signaling in this immune exclusion, with key findings validated through orthogonal analyses. These results underscore the complex spatial transcriptomic and microenvironmental heterogeneity driving treatment resistance and metastasis in pancreatic cancer, providing potential insights for targeted therapeutic strategies.

<break time="700ms"/><emphasis level="strong">Article 6:</emphasis> Targeting PIKfyve-driven lipid metabolism in pancreatic cancer..
From Cheng and colleagues.
Published in Nature in 2025.<break time="300ms"/>
This study identifies PIKfyve, a lipid kinase crucial for lysosomal function, as a targetable vulnerability in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma . Using a genetically engineered mouse model and comprehensive metabolic analyses, researchers demonstrated that PIKfyve is essential for PDAC progression and its inhibition forces a metabolic shift towards de novo lipid synthesis, a process driven by the KRAS-MAPK pathway. Preclinical human and mouse models showed that simultaneous targeting of PIKfyve and KRAS-MAPK resulted in tumor elimination. These findings suggest that disrupting lipid metabolism through PIKfyve inhibition creates synthetic lethality when combined with KRAS-MAPK-directed therapies, offering a potential novel therapeutic approach for PDAC.

<break time="700ms"/><emphasis level="strong">Article 7:</emphasis> Geographic and age variations in mutational processes in colorectal cancer..
From D&amp;#xed and colleagues.
Published in Nature in 2025.<break time="300ms"/>
This study analyzed 981 colorectal cancer genomes from 11 countries to investigate mutational processes underlying geographic and age-related incidence variations. Significant differences in mutation burden and signatures were found in microsatellite-stable cases, reflecting diverse mutagenic exposures across countries. Notably, signatures linked to the bacterial mutagen colibactin  were enriched in high-incidence countries and early-onset cancers , being 3.3 times more frequent than in late-onset cases . Colibactin exposure was also associated with APC driver mutations. These results suggest early-life colibactin exposure may play a role in the increasing incidence of early-onset colorectal cancer.

<break time="700ms"/><emphasis level="strong">Article 8:</emphasis> Tumor-Infiltrating Clonal Hematopoiesis..
From Pich and colleagues.
Published in The New England journal of medicine in 2025.<break time="300ms"/>
This study characterized tumor-infiltrating clonal hematopoiesis  in large cohorts of patients with early-stage NSCLC and other solid tumors, finding it present in a significant proportion of patients with clonal hematopoiesis of indeterminate potential . TI-CH was independently associated with an increased risk of disease recurrence or death in NSCLC and increased all-cause mortality in the pan-cancer cohort compared to patients with CHIP but without TI-CH. Mechanistically, TET2-mutant CHIP, a strong predictor of TI-CH, was shown to enhance monocyte migration, enrich the tumor microenvironment with myeloid cells, and promote tumor growth in experimental models. These findings highlight TI-CH as a novel prognostic factor and suggest that aging-related hematologic clonal expansion can directly influence tumor evolution and patient outcomes by remodeling the tumor microenvironment.

<break time="700ms"/><emphasis level="strong">Article 9:</emphasis> ADAGIO: A Phase IIb, Open-Label, Single-Arm, Multicenter Study Assessing the Efficacy and Safety of Adavosertib  as Treatment for Recurrent or Persistent Uterine Serous Carcinoma..
From Liu and colleagues.
Published in Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology in 2025.<break time="300ms"/>
This phase IIb study assessed adavosertib in patients with recurrent/persistent uterine serous carcinoma previously treated with platinum-based chemotherapy. Adavosertib demonstrated some antitumor activity, achieving an objective response rate of 26.0%  with a median duration of response of 4.7 months. However, the 300 mg daily dose was associated with significant toxicity, with 97.2% experiencing treatment-related adverse events and 60.6% experiencing Grade ≥3 events, leading to discontinuation in 14.7% of patients. Exploratory biomarker analysis suggested a potential association between CCNE1 amplification/high cyclin E1 expression and response. These findings indicate adavosertib has activity in this setting but highlight the need for dose optimization or patient selection strategies to improve tolerability for future clinical development.
