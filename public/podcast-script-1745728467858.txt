<emphasis>Article 1:</emphasis> Tumor-Infiltrating Clonal Hematopoiesis..
From Pich and colleagues.
Published in The New England journal of medicine in 2025.<break time="300ms"/>
This study characterized tumor-infiltrating clonal hematopoiesis (TI-CH), where CHIP mutations are detected in tumors, in patients with NSCLC (n=421) and a large pan-cancer cohort (n=49,351). TI-CH was present in a significant proportion of patients with CHIP (42% in NSCLC, 26% pan-cancer) and independently predicted increased risk of recurrence or death in NSCLC and increased risk of death in solid tumors. TET2 mutations were strongly associated with TI-CH and functionally enhanced monocyte migration, fostered a myeloid-rich tumor microenvironment, and promoted tumor growth in experimental models. These findings demonstrate that TI-CH, an aging-related hematologic phenomenon, significantly influences tumor evolution and prognosis by remodeling the tumor microenvironment.

This phase IIb study evaluated adavosertib in 104 patients with recurrent/persistent uterine serous carcinoma previously treated with platinum-based chemotherapy. Adavosertib demonstrated modest antitumor activity, achieving an objective response rate of 26.0% with a median duration of response of 4.7 months. However, the treatment was associated with significant toxicity, with 97.2% experiencing treatment-related adverse events and 60.6% having Grade â‰¥3 events, leading to a 14.7% discontinuation rate due to TRAEs. Exploratory biomarker analysis suggested a potential association between CCNE1 amplification or high cyclin E1 expression and response. These results indicate adavosertib has some activity in this difficult-to-treat population, but strategies to manage toxicity or select patients based on biomarkers are crucial for optimizing its clinical application.

From Izurieta-Pacheco and colleagues.
Published in Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology in 2025.<break time="300ms"/>
This essay explores the significant, yet often overlooked, challenges inherent in cancer survivorship care. Reflecting on the journey from pediatric oncology, it highlights the complexities survivors face navigating life after treatment. The core message emphasizes the need for increased attention and support for this critical phase. Recognizing and addressing these long-term needs is crucial for optimizing survivor well-being.
