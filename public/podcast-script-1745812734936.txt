<emphasis level="strong">Article 1:</emphasis> Tumor-Infiltrating Clonal Hematopoiesis..
From Pich and colleagues.
Published in The New England journal of medicine in 2025.<break time="300ms"/>
This study characterized tumor-infiltrating clonal hematopoiesis (TI-CH), defined by high variant-allele frequency CHIP mutations in tumors, across large cohorts of patients with NSCLC and other solid tumors. TI-CH was present in a substantial fraction of patients with CHIP and independently predicted an increased risk of disease recurrence or death in NSCLC and increased all-cause mortality in pan-cancer cohorts. Mechanistically, TET2-mutant CHIP, a strong predictor of TI-CH, enhanced monocyte migration, fostered a myeloid-rich tumor microenvironment, and promoted tumor growth in experimental models. These findings indicate that TI-CH is a common phenomenon associated with adverse clinical outcomes and suggest that aging-related clonal hematopoiesis can actively influence tumor evolution and progression by remodeling the tumor microenvironment.

This phase IIb, single-arm study assessed adavosertib (300 mg QD) in 104 patients with recurrent/persistent uterine serous carcinoma previously treated with platinum. The objective response rate by blinded independent central review was 26.0%, with a median duration of response of 4.7 months and median progression-free survival of 2.8 months. Adavosertib demonstrated significant toxicity, with 97.2% experiencing treatment-related adverse events and 60.6% experiencing Grade â‰¥3 events, leading to discontinuation in 14.7% due to TRAEs; exploratory biomarker analysis suggested a potential association with CCNE1/cyclin E1 expression. While showing some antitumor activity, the observed toxicity profile at this dose limits its immediate clinical utility, highlighting the need for further investigation into optimal dosing and patient selection.

From Izurieta-Pacheco and colleagues.
Published in Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology in 2025.<break time="300ms"/>
This essay undertakes a reflective exploration of the significant, often overlooked challenges inherent in cancer survivorship care. It specifically considers the journey from pediatric oncology through supporting individuals in navigating life after active treatment. The work highlights the critical need to address these long-term complexities faced by survivors. This underscores the importance of developing robust strategies to enhance post-treatment support and improve quality of life.
