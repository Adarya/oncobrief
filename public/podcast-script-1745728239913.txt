<emphasis>Article 1:</emphasis> Tumor-Infiltrating Clonal Hematopoiesis..
From Pich and colleagues.
Published in The New England journal of medicine in 2025.<break time="300ms"/>
This study characterized tumor-infiltrating clonal hematopoiesis (TI-CH), where clonal hematopoiesis of indeterminate potential (CHIP) mutations are detected in tumors, across large cohorts of patients with non-small-cell lung cancer (n=421) and various solid tumors (n=49,351). They found that TI-CH was present in a substantial fraction of patients with CHIP and independently predicted an increased risk of disease recurrence or death in NSCLC and increased all-cause mortality in the pan-cancer cohort. Mechanistically, TET2 mutations were strongly associated with TI-CH and functionally promoted monocyte migration, fostered a myeloid-rich tumor microenvironment, and accelerated tumor growth. These findings demonstrate that aging-related clonal hematopoiesis, when infiltrating tumors, significantly impacts clinical outcomes and influences tumor biology, highlighting a novel interaction between systemic aging processes and cancer evolution.

This phase IIb, single-arm study assessed adavosertib in 104 patients with recurrent/persistent uterine serous carcinoma previously treated with platinum-based chemotherapy. Adavosertib demonstrated an objective response rate of 26.0% (95% CI, 17.9-35.5), with a median duration of response of 4.7 months. However, the treatment was associated with significant toxicity, with 60.6% of patients experiencing Grade â‰¥3 treatment-related adverse events, leading to discontinuation in 14.7%. Exploratory biomarker analysis suggested a potential association between CCNE1 amplification or high cyclin E1 expression and response. While showing some antitumor activity, the tolerability profile at this dose indicates that further dose optimization or patient selection based on biomarkers may be necessary for adavosertib in this population.

<break time="700ms"/><emphasis>Article 3:</emphasis> What I Wish I Had Known: A Pediatric Oncologist's Transition to Survivorship Care..
From Izurieta-Pacheco and colleagues.
Published in Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology in 2025.<break time="300ms"/>
This essay explores the significant, yet often overlooked, challenges inherent in cancer survivorship care. Reflecting on the transition from pediatric oncology, it highlights the complex journey survivors face in navigating life post-treatment. The work underscores the critical need for enhanced support systems and dedicated attention to the unique needs of this population. This emphasizes the importance of developing robust survivorship care models.
