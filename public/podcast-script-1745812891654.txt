<emphasis level="strong">Article 1:</emphasis> Tumor-Infiltrating Clonal Hematopoiesis..
From Pich and colleagues.
Published in The New England journal of medicine in 2025.<break time="300ms"/>
This study characterized tumor-infiltrating clonal hematopoiesis (TI-CH), defined as the detection of clonal hematopoiesis of indeterminate potential (CHIP) mutations within tumors, across large cohorts of patients with non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and other solid tumors. They found that TI-CH was present in a substantial fraction of patients with CHIP and independently predicted an increased risk of disease recurrence or death in NSCLC and increased all-cause mortality in solid tumors. Mechanistically, TET2-mutant CHIP, a strong predictor of TI-CH, was shown to enhance monocyte migration, promote a myeloid-rich tumor microenvironment, and accelerate tumor growth in experimental models. These findings establish TI-CH as a novel prognostic factor in cancer patients and suggest that aging-related hematologic clonal expansion can directly influence tumor evolution and clinical outcomes by remodeling the tumor microenvironment.

From Liu and colleagues.

This phase IIb single-arm study evaluated adavosertib (300mg QD) in 104 patients with recurrent/persistent uterine serous carcinoma previously treated with platinum-based chemotherapy. The objective response rate by blinded independent central review was 26.0%, with a median duration of response of 4.7 months and median progression-free survival of 2.8 months. Adavosertib demonstrated significant toxicity, with 60.6% of patients experiencing Grade â‰¥3 treatment-related adverse events, leading to discontinuation in 14.7%. While overall tolerability was poor at this dose, exploratory biomarker analysis suggests potential enrichment for response in patients with CCNE1 amplification or high cyclin E1 expression. These findings indicate modest antitumor activity for adavosertib in this setting but highlight the need for dose optimization or patient selection strategies to improve the therapeutic index.

<break time="700ms"/><emphasis level="strong">Article 3:</emphasis> What I Wish I Had Known: A Pediatric Oncologist's Transition to Survivorship Care..
From Izurieta-Pacheco and colleagues.
Published in Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology in 2025.<break time="300ms"/>
This essay explores the significant, often overlooked challenges inherent in cancer survivorship care, particularly focusing on the transition from pediatric oncology. It reflects on the complex journey survivors face navigating life after treatment completion. The work highlights the critical need for enhanced support systems and greater attention to these post-treatment difficulties. Addressing these challenges is essential for providing comprehensive and effective long-term care for cancer survivors.
