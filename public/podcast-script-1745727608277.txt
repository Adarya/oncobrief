<emphasis>Article 1:</emphasis> Tumor-Infiltrating Clonal Hematopoiesis..
From Pich and colleagues.
Published in The New England journal of medicine in 2025.<break time="300ms"/>
This research characterized tumor-infiltrating clonal hematopoiesis (TI-CH), defined by the presence of CHIP mutations in tumors, across large NSCLC and pan-cancer cohorts. They demonstrated that TI-CH is frequent and independently predicts an increased risk of recurrence or death in NSCLC and solid tumors, even when compared to CHIP without TI-CH. Functional analyses highlighted that TET2-mutant CHIP, strongly associated with TI-CH, promotes a myeloid-rich tumor microenvironment and enhances tumor growth. These results indicate that aging-related hematologic clonal proliferation, through TI-CH, significantly influences tumor evolution and patient outcomes.

From Liu and colleagues.

This phase IIb, single-arm study evaluated adavosertib in 104 patients with recurrent/persistent uterine serous carcinoma previously treated with platinum-based chemotherapy. Adavosertib demonstrated an objective response rate of 26.0%, with a median duration of response of 4.7 months and median progression-free survival of 2.8 months. However, tolerability was challenging at the 300 mg daily dose, with 60.6% experiencing Grade â‰¥3 treatment-related adverse events, leading to a 14.7% discontinuation rate due to treatment-related AEs. Exploratory biomarker analysis suggested a potential association between CCNE1 amplification or high cyclin E1 expression and response. These results indicate adavosertib has some activity in this setting but underscore the need for dose optimization or alternative schedules to improve tolerability and further investigation into predictive biomarkers.

From Izurieta-Pacheco and colleagues.
Published in Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology in 2025.<break time="300ms"/>
This abstract explores the often overlooked challenges inherent in cancer survivorship care. Utilizing a reflective approach, it examines the journey from pediatric oncology support to navigating life after treatment for adult survivors. The core finding is that survivors face significant, often unaddressed, complexities long after active therapy concludes. This highlights the critical need for enhanced understanding and robust support systems tailored to the unique needs of this population. Addressing these challenges is crucial for optimizing the long-term well-being of cancer survivors.
