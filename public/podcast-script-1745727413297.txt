<emphasis>Article 1:</emphasis> Tumor-Infiltrating Clonal Hematopoiesis..
From Pich and colleagues.
Published in The New England journal of medicine in 2025.<break time="300ms"/>
This study characterized tumor-infiltrating clonal hematopoiesis (TI-CH) in large cohorts of patients with early-stage non-small-cell lung cancer and various solid tumors. They found TI-CH is frequent among patients with clonal hematopoiesis of indeterminate potential (CHIP) and independently predicts an increased risk of disease recurrence or death. Functional analyses demonstrated that TET2 mutations, strongly associated with TI-CH, enhance monocyte migration and promote a pro-tumorigenic myeloid microenvironment, accelerating tumor growth. These findings indicate that TI-CH is a significant prognostic factor and actively contributes to cancer evolution by remodeling the tumor immune microenvironment, highlighting a role for age-related hematologic clonal proliferation in tumor progression.

This phase IIb single-arm study evaluated adavosertib in patients with recurrent/persistent uterine serous carcinoma previously treated with platinum-based chemotherapy. The study reported an objective response rate of 26.0% (95% CI, 17.9-35.5), with a median duration of response of 4.7 months and median progression-free survival of 2.8 months. However, adavosertib demonstrated significant toxicity, with 97.2% experiencing treatment-related adverse events, 60.6% having Grade â‰¥3 events, and 17.4% discontinuing due to adverse events. Exploratory biomarker analysis suggested a potential association between CCNE1 amplification or high cyclin E1 expression and response. While showing some antitumor activity, adavosertib at 300 mg daily was poorly tolerated in this population, indicating the need for optimized dosing or patient selection strategies.

From Izurieta-Pacheco and colleagues.
Published in Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology in 2025.<break time="300ms"/>
This essay reflects on the often overlooked challenges inherent in cancer survivorship care. It explores the journey from pediatric oncology settings to the ongoing support required for adult survivors navigating life after treatment. The core finding is the identification of these significant, yet frequently unaddressed, challenges in post-treatment life. This underscores the vital need to enhance support systems and clinical focus on the long-term needs of cancer survivors.
