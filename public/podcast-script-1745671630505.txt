The Oncology Grand Rounds series is designed to contextualize original research reports within clinical practice. Each installment employs a structured approach, beginning with a case presentation, followed by a discussion of diagnostic and management challenges, a review of relevant literature, and suggested management strategies. This methodology aims to facilitate clinicians' understanding of how to apply key study findings, including those published in the Journal of Clinical Oncology, to patient care. Ultimately, the series serves as a practical guide for translating research into actionable clinical decisions.
